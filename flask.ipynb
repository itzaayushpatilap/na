    "ans - Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features. It does have many cool features like url routing, template engine. It is a WSGI web app framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask framework:\n",
    "Scalable:\n",
    "Due to its status as a microframework, Flask may use it to quickly grow technological projects like web apps. If you want to make an app that starts out modest but has the potential to grow quickly and in areas you haven’t completely explored, this is a great option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible:\n",
    "This is the most crucial aspect of Flask and one of its key benefits. To paraphrase one of the Zen of Python’s maxims, simplicity can move about and rearrange more easily than complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negotiation is simple:\n",
    "To enable web developers to concentrate entirely on coding without becoming bogged down, navigational simplicity, like Django, is essential. The microframework’s core concepts are straightforward, saving web developers time and effort while giving them more control over the functionality of their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight:\n",
    "When we discuss a tool’s or framework’s design, we mean how few parts need to build and put back together, and how it doesn’t rely on a lot of extensions to function. Web developers have some control over using this method."
